## Definition of Alexandrian Number

A number `A` is said to be an Alexandrian if and only if there are three numbers which their multiplication equals that number and the reciprocal of `A` equals the summation of the multiplicative inverse of the three numbers as shown below:

```
A = p . q . r

```
AND
```
1/A = 1/p + 1/q + 1/r
```

## Formula to Solve for Solutions

```
p . (p + d) . (p + (p^2 + 1)/d )
```
where `p` integer positive number and `d` is the divisor of `p^2 + 1`.
